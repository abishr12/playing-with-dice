# Fancy A Dice Game!

This project combines HTML5 and CSS3 techniques with a powerful Javascript
engine to build out a fun dice game for anybody who wants to play!

## Rules

1. The game has 2 players, playing in rounds In each turn, a player rolls a dice
   as many times as he wishes.
2. Each result get added to his ROUND score. When the player chooses to stop
   rolling, they may click the HOLD button to end their turn.

3. BUT, if the player rolls a 1 or a total of 12, all his ROUND score gets lost.

4. After that, it's the next player's turn The player can choose to 'Hold',
   which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that,
   it's the next player's turn The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL
   score wins the game
